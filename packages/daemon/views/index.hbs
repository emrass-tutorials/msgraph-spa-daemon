    <p class="lead">The User Sync app is app that uses the Microsoft identity platform endpoint to authenticate to the
        <a href="https://graph.microsoft.io">Microsoft Graph</a> in order to sync an organization's employee data.
        It is intended to show the use of the admin consent endpoint to configure and request direct application
        permissions from a company's administrator. The app then uses those permissions to access the company's data in
        an "offline" fashion.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        The User Sync app uses client credentials to periodically pull the list of users from an organizations
        directory, in a background process.
        The sync process occurs in <code>/sync/run</code>, which can be invoked manually (e.g. via Postman).
        For a true daemon scenario, this controller would be invoked periodically by a CRON job, Azure Web
        Job, or other time/event based script.
